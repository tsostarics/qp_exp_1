# QP Experiment 1: Qualitative Responses to HLL/LLL Responses

Change the condition by changing the `LATIN_COND` variable in `experiment.js`.

Sound files not available on github (intending on adding to OSF later)

The `jspsych-audio-buttons.js` file is a custom jsPsych plugin I've written. It plays an audio stimulus but also provides multiple buttons that the participant can click on. There's also a text box and a likert scale with which to provide responses. This is essentially blending together the audio-text and likert-scale plugins from jsPsych, but also adding buttons that play audio. Plugin tracks the number of times each button is clicked, and each button can be made required to be clicked.

Thanks to Hyoung Seok Kwon and Lisa Sullivan for their sound test.
